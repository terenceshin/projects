12,What a pleasant surprise,What a pleasant surprise! I had been with an old advisor for a decade and tried the Wealthsimple service out of curiosity (and used their portfolio review service). They opened my eyes to how bad of a service I was getting - I paid such high fees for a portfolio that was not diversified and did not perform well. I moved my investments to Wealthsimple and have been very happy so far.,2019-06-14,5 stars: Excellent,5

19,HIGHLY recommend Wealthsimple!,I joined Wealthsimple nearly two years ago after it was recommended to me by a friend who used their service in Canada. I've been nothing but impressed with them!! Such a slick product and I love that I can add as little or as much money as I want whenever through my debit card. I've spoken with a couple of the investment advisers and found them to be super knowledgeable and felt they genuinely cared about my financial circumstances. Their customer service is incredible as well. Would recommend to everyone!,2019-07-05,5 stars: Excellent,5

21,Out performed my Nutmeg account.,"Out performed my Nutmeg account.So It is my one year anniversary with Wealthsimple...how time flies. I opened an ISA with them at around this time under a conservative setting. In parallel I opened a regular account with Nutmeg using a risk level of 6 out of 10 which I perceived as higher risk but greater chance of a reward compared to the Wealthsimple conservative profile. Nutmeg required an initial startup of £500 compared to Wealthsimple who were happy to start with £1. So I opened my Wealthsimple ISA with £100 and had regular payments of equal value to both Wealthsimple and Nutmeg despite different starting amounts. I stopped regular payments at a point and watched. Today, as a result of the different starting amounts, my nutmeg account has more than 3 times the value of money put in, in comparison to the Wealthsimple account and yet my overall earning between both accounts are very similar!My weathsimple account is now cruising at 5.5% growth using the time-weight measure or 6.5% using the money weight measure. So this is not a discredit to Nutmeg who made some profit but a big applause to Wealthsimple who significantly outperformed. My biggest regret was having not put more money/faith in them earlier. The only reason its not 5 starts is because I want to see how it performs in some years before awarding that last star.",2019-07-11,4 stars: Great,4
22,Great company,My issue was resolved satisfactorily and I am changing my rating to 5 stars. Thank you for a wonderful customer service! Special thanks goes to Andrew for handling my concerns. I recommend this company to investors and traders. Cheers!,2019-07-12,5 stars: Excellent,5
23,"Great user focus. Simple, safe and smart","Great customer service with fast response time to emails. It’s nice being able to email rather than having to use messages on the site. The emails they sent me were clear, concise, coherent.Also lots of proactive communication (totally unprompted) from Wealthsimple on things I care about (such as the status of my transfer) was nice too.I like the 2-step security option - shows they care about the security of my investment.",2019-07-31,5 stars: Excellent,5
24,Finally an investment app I understand,"Finally an investment app I understand! I’ve never had a clue about investments but I wanted to start investing for my future so I created a Wealthsimple account. After talking through a financial plan with one of the lovely advisers there, I think his name was Billy. They set me up with a plan that suited my circumstances and I have watched my investments grow on the app ever since! I'm still new at this so i'm going slow and gradual but what an app! Would definitely recommend!I had one query on some of the questions but as soon as I spoke to the wonderful advisor everything made sense!",2019-07-31,5 stars: Excellent,5
25,Wealthsimple is the name of the game,"Wealthsimple is the name of the game - they have made investing available for everyone... especially for millennials who say they don't know what they're doing. Not to mention they have speedy and great customer service so if you have to ask any ""stupid"" questions, you can. I used WS when I lived in Canada and just re-started the app while living in London and I forgot how easy the sign up process was! Furthermore, I love the accessibility of making direct debits and watching your money grow through visual charts.",2019-08-01,5 stars: Excellent,5
26,Easiest way to start investing,"The easiest way to get into the stock market. I was a bit apprehensive about an AI investing platform, but it's been 6 months with them now and the results speak for themselves.As can be expected with the stock market, stock values fluctuate and you're never guaranteed a sure shot way to make money in the short term. But the immediate reactionary nature of the AI system reduces the chances of significant losses.In any case, if you want to way to store your savings and make sure this money is actually working for you, I recommend Wealthsimple as all the steps are laid out clearly and information on the website is very informative. The staff at the firm are very helpful whenever you need help with whichever questions you might have.",2019-08-18,5 stars: Excellent,5
27,One of the better roboinvestors,One of the better automated investing platforms. I've used quite a few and Wealthsimple have good people behind it who managed to help grow my portfolio. The app is also clean and secure and it's easy to add funds to it.,2019-08-19,5 stars: Excellent,5

30,Zero friction financial solution,"I've been with Wealthsimple for a year now and it's been nothing but excellent from start to finish. I've become an accidental salesperson for the company as every time I'm out with friends I inevitably champion the product to them. Investing done right, with zero friction!",2019-09-09,5 stars: Excellent,5

38,"Great product, and service","I have been a customer for a number of years now. Started with one Invest account, then Savings, TFSA, RRSP, Corporate, Trade, now Trade TFSA, for me and family members. I am invested in all their products. The fees are reasonable, and they take care of investing and rebalancing my portfolios. What is more, I have only words of praise for their customer support. I called a number of times to request various documents of letters, and the issues were always resolved promptly and professionally. These days customer support is a bid differentiator.",2019-11-23,5 stars: Excellent,5

41,Just a basic Stocks & Shares ISA...nothing special here!,"If all you want is a basic Stocks & Shares ISA, and don’t want to have to leave your chair to get one, then these guys are for you!I personally felt extremely misled by their advertisements, they gave the impression of being almost like a personal broker, where you could assign money where you’d like, at what risk level you’d like.That’s not the case at all, it’s even more tightly locked down than my Royal London S&S ISA. They wouldn’t allow me to change my risk level (putting me at a poultry 3 out of 7, resulting in a projection of me doubling my money...in 28 YEARS...) despite stating it in writing that I’d like to do so.Seems extremely tightly regulated to me, I guess it makes sense after 2007, but please don’t expect Gordon Gekko to be handling your account, more like Howard from the Halifax (both dated, but valid references)!",2019-12-03,3 stars: Average,3
42,poor customer service,I really like the simplicity of the app/ website and invest quite a bit with wealth simple.Unfortunately a recent experience with customer service is making me question my choices and forcing me to look elsewhere.I over contributed to an RRSP and wealth simple told me they would look into revert the whole transaction (~13k).Rather than reverting the whole transaction they decided to revert a small amount. The frustrating thing is there was no communication as to why or any information about what was going on. No response to emails either so I’m currently left in the dark.The annoying thing is I was going to invest the ~13k directly back into a non registered account.———In response to your last message. I’ve been contacting your support via that email over the past 5 weeks. I’ve not had a response for 35 days now. Your customer support is a joke.,2019-12-22,1 star: Bad,1

We opened an account about 18 months ago; it was easy to set up; the qualified investment adviser advised us on risks and rewards and help us to set up our account with our needs and attitudes in mind. We check performance regularly using the great APP and Internet Site. Our money has done very well, very well indeed! Its easy to add money and withdraw money.

56,"These nice people at Wealthsimple, but....","These nice people at Wealthsimple. Except for at least one important detail! You are not able to withdraw your investment in quite the same simple way as one would hope. There are no instant withdrawals. The transfer takes ten business days. Basically two weeks.  And in that time your money is still open to market fluctuations and losses! One should be given the price of your investment on the day you request the withdrawal surely. Instead of getting the price some days later. This can be very costly, be warned. I wonder why such a tech savvy company offers such an (unfair) delay.",2020-02-28,3 stars: Average,3

Re-initiated the withdrawal again on February 20th and still have not received my money. Multiple discussions with customer service have been completely useless, and counterproductive.

I also have investments elsewhere in a SIPP invested by a financial adviser and a ISA, which I invested myself. Wealthsimple advised me to pick a conservative portfolio, and the recent coronavirus stock market crash has proved them completely right. My Wealthsimple portfolio briefly dipped into a small loss, but in the last week is back to a small profit. I am delighted, and actually surprised because my other investments are well down, and one of the funds I chose for myself is around 40% down. I am also beginning to see that the robo part does. Most of the year there have been very few transactions, but recently I can see that they have rebalanced to restore the correct ratio of equities and bonds. Since equities have gone down, there were too many bonds in the mix. So they have sold bonds and bought equities - which means, hopefully, they have bought near the bottom of the market.",2020-04-09,5 stars: Excellent,5

I am just trying to call them to cancel both transactions now but customer service are not even available to answer ... I will try to again tomorrow to reach them but if not I will just close my account and retransfer all my money back in my bank account as soon as their confirmed both transactions.Just read some comment here saying today that people had great customer service experience, now I am kind of doubting the authenticity of those comments.Definitely not recommend this company, 16 days to open an account and no customer service back up in case of issue.Update 22/04:Email sent to customer service on the 16th still no answers, tried to called couple of time since then still after waiting around 30min the automatic voice just said can’t take the call today and hang up.Now it’s a joke 22 day since I opened my account and my transfers are still pending.

Wealth Simple seem to do their work and have looked after 60K of hard earnt cash so far. Fees are a little high, but its only due to their customer services and performance i can bear it.

I sent over 15 emails to them over a span of a month, including submitting requests and sending emails to the “support team” and still yet no responses at all.
