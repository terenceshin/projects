# Recommendation_system

## The purpose of this project is to show how different recommendation systems can be built. In this interface, there are four ways in which movies are recommended.
### 1) Most popular movies (most reviewed)
### 2) Highest rated movies
### 3) Recommendations by Matrix Factorization
### 4) Recommendations by similarity score

#### movie_rec_system.py - where the main code is stored
#### matrix_factorization_utilities.py - this is essentially a library created by Adam Geitgey that allows you to conduct matrix factorization easily
#### movie_ratings_data_set.csv - data with user_id's and movie ratings 
#### movies.csv - information pertaining to each movie
